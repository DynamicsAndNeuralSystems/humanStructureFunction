function W = threshold_arbmeasure(W, M, p)
%THRESHOLD_ARBMEASURE     Threshold edges ranked by given arbitrary measure
%
%   W_thr = threshold_arbmeasure(W, M, p);
%
%   This function "thresholds" the connectivity matrix by preserving a
%   proportion p (0<p<1) of the edges with the largest values of the given
%   measure M. All other weights, and all weights on the main diagonal
%   (self-self connections) are set to 0. 
%
%   Inputs: W,      weighted or binary connectivity matrix
%           M,      matrix of values of the measure by which to rank each
%                   node, preserving only edges with the largest values
%           p,      proportion of weights to preserve
%                       range:  p=1 (all weights preserved) to
%                               p=0 (no weights removed)
%
%   Output: W_thr,  thresholded connectivity matrix
