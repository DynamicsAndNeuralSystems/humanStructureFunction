function [W_thr,Wcv] = threshold_consistency(Ws, p)
%THRESHOLD_CONSISTENCY    Threshold edges ranked by consistency
%
%   W_thr = threshold_consistency(Ws, p);
%
%   This function "thresholds" the group mean connectivity matrix of a set
%   of connectivity matrices by preserving a proportion p (0<p<1) of the
%   edges with the smallest coefficient of variation across the group. All
%   other weights, and all weights on the main diagonal (self-self
%   connections) are set to 0.
%
%   Inputs: Ws,     N-by-N-by-M group of M weighted connectivity matrices
%           p,      proportion of weights to preserve
%                       range:  p=1 (all weights preserved) to
%                               p=0 (no weights removed)
%
%   Output: W_thr,  thresholded group mean connectivity matrix

Wmean=mean(Ws,3); % group mean connectivity matrix

W_thr=threshold_arbmeasure(Wmean,-Wcv,p); % threshold by low CV = high consistency
