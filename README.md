This repository contains code to reproduce the main analyses of Fallon et al. (2019).

### Plots of data for the schematic

Produce data for schematic figure (Figure 1):
```matlab
dataPlotsForSchematic
```

### High-frequency power versus weighted degree (with partial correction):
Produces Fig. 2A:

```matlab
corr_lfp_ns
```

### Plot power spectral density curves for selected regions (Figure 2C)

```matlab
PSD_plot
```

### Inter-individual differences in correlations (Figure 3)

```matlab
individual
```

### Comparison of selected feature to other choices from _hctsa_ (Figure 4)

```matlab
hctsa_corr
```
